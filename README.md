# KotlinDataStructuresAlgos
data structures and algorithms in Kotlin for JVM development

## Features
### Bag
Or multiset. Basically a HashMap<T, Int> with the values being the cardinalities of the keys in it.
### IndefiniteSizeMatrix
As the name says. With putting items in the matrix with setAll, we can expand it arbitrarily, we don't have to set any size in advance at all.

## Licence
Apache-2.0 (do with it whatever you please)
